23;American Pie;Don McLean;"A long, long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die""  Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock 'n roll Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die""  Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die"" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?  We started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die""  Oh, and there we were, all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die...""  I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  And they were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"" ""This'll be the day that I die""  They were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie"" Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die...""121EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

34;Piano Man;Billy Joel;"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday The regular crowd shuffles in There's an old man sittin' next to me Makin' love to his tonic and gin He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory? I'm not really sure how it goes But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete When I wore a younger man's clothes"" La, la-la, di-dee-da La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  Now John at the bar is a friend of mine He gets me my drinks for free And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke But there's someplace that he'd rather be He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me"" As the smile ran away from his face ""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star If I could get out of this place"" Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum  Now Paul is a real estate novelist Who never had time for a wife And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy And probably will be for life And the waitress is practicing politics As the businessmen slowly get stoned Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness But it's better than drinkin' alone   Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright  It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday And the manager gives me a smile 'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see To forget about life for a while And the piano, it sounds like a carnival And the microphone smells like a beer And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?"" Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum  Sing us a song, you're the piano man Sing us a song tonight Well, we're all in the mood for a melody And you've got us feeling alright 89EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
