70;Somethin' Stupid;Frank Sinatra;"I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me  Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you"" I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before  I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you  The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""  The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""  ""I love you"" ""I love you"" ""I love you"" ""I love you"" ""I love you""14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
