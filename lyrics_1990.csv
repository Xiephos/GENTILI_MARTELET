84;When You Believe;Whitney Houston;"Many nights we've prayed With no proof anyone could hear In our hearts a hopeful song We barely understood Now, we are not afraid Although we know there's much to fear We were moving mountains Long before we knew we could  There can be miracles when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve? When you believe, somehow you will You will when you believe  In this time of fear When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer birds Too swiftly flown away Yet now I'm standing here My heart's so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say There can be miracles when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve? When you believe, somehow you will You will when you    believe  They don't always happen when you ask And it's easy to give in to your fears But when you're blinded by your pain Can't see your way clear through the rain A small but still resilient voice says ""Help is very near!""  There can be miracles when you believe Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill Who knows what miracles you can achieve? When you believe, somehow you will Now, you will, you will when you believe You will when you believe, just believe Just believe, you will when you believe4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
